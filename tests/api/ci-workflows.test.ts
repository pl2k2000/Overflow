    // or an empty advisories map with a nonzero exit. Those fixtures now exist,
    // so the string is a second line of defence rather than the only one, and
    // it is worth keeping anyway because it fails for a different reason than
    // the behavioural suite: exact equality makes drift impossible, so the only

  // with no version comment is reported at `help` severity, which falls below
  // the `regular` persona floor the gate runs under and exits 0; the same pin
  // carrying a STALE comment is reported at `warning` and exits 13. So the
  // annotation is what puts a pin under that audit, and dropping it is silent —
  // the state issue 1022 found for Nitjsefnie-Actions/pr-gate. This is the check
  // that closes it. It reads the raw text because a YAML parse drops the comment,
  // and it does NOT assert which release the comment names: that half is zizmor's
  // warning-severity job and duplicating it here would restate a value.
  //
  // Three ways that went wrong the first time round, all of them silent, so the
  // shape below is load-bearing rather than incidental:
  //
  //  - `owner/repo/subpath` is a real shape and this tree uses it three times
  //    (github/codeql-action/init, /analyze, /upload-sarif). A selector written
  //    `[\w.-]+\/[\w.-]+` cannot match two path segments, so all three were
  //    invisible to this case AND to zizmor, whose missing-comment arm is
  //    help-severity and suppressed under the gate's persona. `(?:\/[\w.-]+)*`
  //    takes any number of further segments; a spelling-independent sweep
  //    (detect a pin by `uses:` + an `@` + 40 hex, never by its path shape) puts
  //    the tree at 33 real pins, 33 matched.
  //  - The liveness guard counts PINS, not workflow FILES. A selector that
  //    silently matches nothing sits between the two, and a file-count guard
  //    stays green across that. Rotting `{40}` to `{39}` — one character — used
  //    to pass with a version comment deleted.
  //  - The comment shape is anchored to digits. `#\s*v\S+` is satisfied by
  //    `# verify against the action docs`, which zizmor does NOT back up: it
  //    treats any present comment as annotated. `v\d+\.\d+\.\d+` is zizmor's own
  //    shape and matches every comment the tree ships today.
  //
  // A fourth hole, of a different kind, was left open by that fix round: the
  // guard above proves the pin list is NON-EMPTY, and the property this case is
  // named for is that the list is COMPLETE. `> 0` cannot tell those apart, and a
  // selector that quietly narrows stays green — which is exactly the state the
  // case shipped in for one commit. A number would close it and rot on every
  // dependency bump. So the coverage is asserted by COMPARING TWO INSTRUMENTS
  // instead of quoting a constant: `shapeFree` encodes no path shape at all, so
  // it cannot inherit `pin`'s blind spot, and the two sets are compared for
  // equality. Neither side is a literal, so adding or removing a pin moves both
  // and the assertion holds; narrowing one side only is the defect, and the diff

    // What these three assertions do and do not establish, since the previous
    // round's note claimed both directions and only had one:
    //
    //  - `pin`'s set is a SUBSET of `shapeFree`'s, structurally: everything
    //    `[\w.-]+(?:\/[\w.-]+)*` matches is non-space, so `\S+` matches it too,
    //    and the terminators are shared. So `pin` cannot invent a pin, and the
    //    equality below can only ever fail through `population \ matched`.
    //    That containment is a PROPERTY, not a licence: it does not by itself
    //    say the detector is right about what it matched.
    //  - It is why the equality and a one-sided `population \ matched == []` are
    //    the SAME test here, not two grades of strictness — measured over the
    //    adversarial forms, they disagreed on 0 cases. So narrowing the assertion
    //    to the "covered" direction was tried and discarded: it closed nothing,
    //    because the false red this case was fixing lives in the detector
    //    matching something that is not a pin, not in the comparison's strictness.
    //  - What is NOT established. Below is a SAMPLE of forms measured against these
    //    two regexes, not a census of them: an earlier version of this comment
    //    called the list a census, and measuring showed that was false. Three
    //    directions, all open:
    //
    //    (a) Forms NEITHER regex matches. The pins leave both sets together and
    //        nothing here can see them. Measured examples: a `uses:` inside a
    //        comment or prose (the anchor), a `- {uses: …}` flow mapping with or
    //        without a comment, a `docker://img@sha256:<64hex>` container
    //        digest, an `&anchor` on the value, a folded `>-`, and a `.yaml`
    //        workflow file (filtered out at the `readdir`). CRLF is NOT in this
    //        list: the `split(/\r?\n/)` above already covers it.
    //        REACHABLE AND SILENT, and the reason the sample matters: a QUOTED
    //        scalar — `- uses: "owner/repo@<40hex>"` — is legal YAML, matches
    //        neither regex, and a workflow holding only unannotated quoted or
    //        uppercase pins leaves this case green while reporting full
    //        coverage. That is the exact failure this case exists to prevent,
    //        still open, and not fixed here.
    //
    //    (b) Forms `shapeFree` accepts and `pin` rejects — DETECTOR-ONLY. On
    //        any of these the equality fails, naming a pin `pin` cannot read.
    //        Naming the five I happened to try is worse than naming the class:
    //        sweeping every printable ASCII character into a subpath segment
    //        leaves the two disagreeing on TWENTY-EIGHT of them —
    //        `!"#$%&'()*+,:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~` — because each is outside `[\w.-]`
    //        while `\S+` accepts it. Plus any scheme that is not
    //        lowercase-with-`//` (`DOCKER://`, `Docker://`, `docker:/`). None is
    //        a form GitHub's syntax reference documents or shows an example of;
    //        that reference gives no character grammar for a path segment, so
    //        this is "undocumented", not "impossible", and a red on one of them
    //        is the DETECTOR talking rather than a pin that lost its comment.
    //
    //    (c) A form BOTH regexes read as an action pin, on which this case
    //        demands a `vN.N.N` comment: GitHub documents
    //        `{owner}/{repo}/.github/workflows/{filename}@{ref}`, and a SHA ref
    //        matches here. Whether a reusable-workflow call should carry a
    //        version comment is a policy this case never stated; zizmor 1.30.1
    //        at `--persona=pedantic` reports no finding on such a line even with
    //        a deliberately wrong version, so nothing else settles it. If one
    //        appears here without a comment, this case will red it and no gate
    //        would.
    //
    //    These are recorded limits, not closed routes, and the sample is not the
    //    full set of either class. No assertion here pretends otherwise.

  /**
   * OpenSSF Scorecard is the instrument that MEASURES this repository's
   * supply-chain hardening — hash-pinned actions, explicit workflow
   * permissions, CodeQL, Dependabot — so a regression in that regime is
   * otherwise invisible: every other workflow keeps passing while the practice
   * that produced them quietly stops. The ways below are the ones where every
   * run concludes SUCCESS and the Security tab is still empty, which is why
   * "the workflow exists" is not a pin and no assertion here accepts one.
   *
   * 1. **A trigger that never fires.** A `push` or `pull_request` trigger
   *    carrying a branch filter yields a workflow GitHub schedules and never
   *    runs: every conclusion is green and no score is ever produced.
   * 2. **A cron that fires on the wrong tick.** A different mechanism and a
   *    different consequence, so it is a separate case rather than a clause of
   *    the one above: a valid-but-mistyped slot is not silence, it is a reading
   *    taken at an hour nobody looks, INVISIBLE in a run history rather than
   *    absent from it. The `on` equality below catches it as a value mismatch,
   *    not as a missing run — that equality is the only thing catching it.
   * 3. **A contribution-event trigger.** The opposite failure, and the one the
   *    `on` equality exists to prevent: a `pull_request` arm makes Scorecard a
   *    second gate on a commit `ci` already checks, spending a pull-request
   *    run on a signal that is allowed to be flat.
   * 4. **A job that never starts.** The `if` guard is where a skip hides,
   *    because a skipped job is indistinguishable from a green one in a run
   *    summary. A fork's run, or a manual dispatch on any ref but the default
   *    branch, publishes findings for a tree this repository is not
   *    responsible for, and a score describing a different tree than the badge.
   * 5. **A run that produces no SARIF.** `results_format` other than `sarif`,
   *    or `publish_results` off, leaves the Security tab empty while every run
   *    is green — an instrument that measures nothing is indistinguishable
   *    from one measuring a healthy repository.
   * 6. **A SARIF upload that cannot succeed, and a score that cannot be
   *    attributed.** Without `security-events: write` the upload step fails
   *    while the workflow still reports; without `id-token: write` the
   *    published result carries no signature, so a consumer cannot verify the
   *    score came from this repository's own run.
   * 7. **A step that is not pinned, or is pinned to the wrong action.** A tag
   *    or branch ref moves under the workflow, so the action that produced a
   *    Security-tab finding is not the one that was reviewed. A substitution at
   *    a VALID digest is the shape the digest regex cannot see.
   * 8. **A key nobody reads.** Every assertion in this test reads a key this
   *    workflow is expected to carry, so a key they do NOT read is a hole
   *    rather than a coverage gap — and the same is true one level down of a
   *    key that IS read. Both of these shipped and both read green under
   *    actionlint and zizmor: an unpinned top-level `env:` block, and a second
   *    job carrying `contents: write` beside the one this suite pins. The two
   *    key-set equalities are what close them.
   * 9. **A run that never ends.** With no `timeout-minutes` a hung analysis
   *    holds a runner and concludes nothing at all.
   * 10. **A gate that is not a gate.** Promoting `scorecard` into
   *    `.github/required-checks.json` turns a weekly trend signal into a
   *    blocking check on every pull request; this is the last place that shows
   *    up before the deploy gate refuses the merge.
